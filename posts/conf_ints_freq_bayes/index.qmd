Write about how thinking in a bayesian and frequentist way can both be useful.

They both rely on probability theory, but have different aims.

Frequentist: Create procedures that have favorable long-run properties when assumptions are met
Bayesian: Create a model that includes prior belief about parameters and see how the data should affect that belief

Emphasize that bayes procedures can be evaluated in a frequentist way

Show that bayes with flat priors can be equivalent to a standard frequentist CI

Motivate the whole discussion with inference for a proportion.

- Introduce the problem of inference for a proportion using a story
- Explain the problem again using mathematical notation
- Show how a frequentist test is conducted. With type 1 and type 2 errors simulated
- Show how a frequentist CI is constructed. Show how coverage changes with n and true values of \theta.
- Show how a bayesian approaches the problem with beta binomial conjugate prior.
- Show how MCMC can be used to solve the problem with any prior
- show the frequentist coverage of the bayesian procedures

Read the first few chapters of computer age statistical inference and use it to guide some of the discussion.
