title: Why it's wrong to analyze change-within-groups for clinical trials

When analyzing data from clinical trials, the proper approach is to compare differences between groups. However, some investigators instead compare within groups, which is not a valid approach for analyzing clinical trials data. We can illustrate this with an example.

Assume we are asked to analyze the results of a hypothetical trial for an antiviral drug. The trial design was as follows:

CHANGE THE STATISTIC TO THE DIFF IN CHANGE IN VIRAL LOAD

1) Each patient's viral load^[Viral load is a measurement of the quantity of virus in a given volume of fluid such as the blood.] is measured at baseline (time 1).
2) The patients in the treatment group receive a dose of the antiviral drug, while the patients in the control group receive a placebo.
3) Each patient's viral load is measured again (time 2).
4) For each patient, compute the difference in viral load between time 2 and time 1. We can call this the viral load change.

ADD IN THE VIRAL LOAD CHANGE TERMINOLOGY.

The proper approach would compute a statistic such as the mean viral load at time 2 in the treatment group and the mean viral load at time 2 in the control group, and test if the difference of these means is zero. We could also construct a confidence interval for the difference in means. The key point is that we are focusing on the difference between the groups post-baseline.

However, another approach is often taken that is not valid. Instead of comparing the treatment and control groups directly, each group is compared with itself from time 1 to time 2. In this example, we could test if the mean viral load at time 2 was less than at time 1 for treatment and control groups separately. If we observe a significant decrease comparing time 2 to time 1 for the treatment group but not the control group, we might conclude that the treatment is effective. This is not a valid approach. We will show in the remainder of this post through simulation why it is flawed. The main reasons are that clinical trials are randomized so that 

DOES X decrease over time?
DOES Y decrease over time?


## Overview

```{r}
generate_data <- function(n, mean, sd, time_effect) {
  list(
    "Control Group: Time 1" = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean, sd = sd),
    "Control Group: Time 2" = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean + time_effect, sd = sd),
    "Treatment Group: Time 1" = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean, sd = sd),
    "Treatment Group: Time 2" = rnorm(n = n, mean = mean + time_effect, sd = sd)
  )
}
```

```{r}
run_simulation <- function(){
  data <- generate_null_data(n = 10, mean=10, sd=1)
  
  control_group_difference <-
    data[["Control Group: Time 2"]] - data[["Control Group: Time 1"]]
  
  treatment_group_difference <-
    data[["Treatment Group: Time 2"]] - data[["Treatment Group: Time 1"]]
  
  control_group_p_value <- t.test(control_group_difference)$p.value
  treatment_group_p_value <- t.test(treatment_group_difference)$p.value
  
  # Calculate if treatment difference is significant but control difference is not
  treatment_sig_control_not_sig <-
    (treatment_group_p_value < 0.05) & (control_group_p_value > 0.05)
  
  return(c(
    "Control Group p-value" = control_group_p_value,
    "Treatment Group p-value" = treatment_group_p_value,
    "Treatment Signficant / Control Not Significant" = treatment_sig_control_not_sig
  ))
}
```

```{r}
simulation_results <-
  map_df(1:1e4, ~run_simulation()) |>
  mutate(`Treatment Signficant / Control Not Significant` = as.logical(`Treatment Signficant / Control Not Significant`))
```
