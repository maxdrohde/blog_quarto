# Conditions

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rlang)
```

## Overview

The **condition** system has two parts.

First there are signals:

- `stop()`
- `warning()`
- `message()`

and handlers:

- `tryCatch()`
- `withCallingHandlers()`

> Like Râ€™s approach to object-oriented programming, it is rather different to currently popular programming languages so it is easy to misunderstand, and there has been relatively little written about how to use it effectively.

## Conditions

There are three conditions in R:

- Errors -- uses `stop()` or `rlang::abort()`
- Warnings -- uses `warning()` or `rlang::warn()`
- Messages -- uses `message()`

## Ignoring conditions

Use `try()` to ignore errors and `tryCatch()` to execute a certain action when an error occurs.
