```

## Question

```
I am trying to apply a function to each element of a vector, then to all elements of the vector.
 
For example:
I have my vector: numbers <- c(1,2)
 
Then my purr function to print them in a list: map(numbers, ~. )
 
[[1]]
[1] 1
 
[[2]]
[1] 2
 
How can apply the function to both numbers in the vector also, so my output looks something like :
[[1]]
[1] 1
 
[[2]]
[1] 2
 
[[3]]
[1] 1 2
```

## Solution

```{r}
numbers <- c(1,2)
```

```{r}
square <- function(x) x^2
```

```{r}
map(numbers, ~square(.x)) %>%     
    append(list(square(numbers))) 
    
```
