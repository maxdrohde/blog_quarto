With type 1 and type 2 errors simulated\n- Show how a frequentist CI is constructed. Show how coverage changes with n and true values of \\theta.\n- Show how a bayesian approaches the problem with beta binomial conjugate prior.\n- Show how MCMC can be used to solve the problem with any prior\n- show the frequentist coverage of the bayesian procedures\n\nRead the first few chapters of computer age statistical inference and use it to guide some of the discussion.\n",
